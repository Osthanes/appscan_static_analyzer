ExtName=(Beta) IBM Security Static Analyzer
ExtDesc=Run a static security code scan by using the IBM Security Static Analyzer on Bluemix 
ExtMessage=To leverage this extension, you must have the IBM Security Static Analyzer service added to your space. You can automatically add the service (see free plan <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/sla/bm-6814-01">Terms of Use</a>) and bind it to a bridge app by selecting "Set up service and space for me" below.

ACCEPT_KEY=Set up service and space for me
ACCEPT_DESC=When this option is set to true, and the service is not already in your space, the builder attempts to add an instance on the "free" plan into this space and bind it to the containerbridge app to create the necessary credentials to run. Review the <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/sla/bm-6814-01">Terms of Use</a>.

SUBMISSION_NAME_KEY=Submission name 
SUBMISSION_NAME_DESC=The base name of the Static Analyzer job to be submitted. This will be used for the name of the scan in the analysis submission queue.

WAIT_TIME_KEY=Minutes to wait for analysis to complete (0 - 59)
WAIT_TIME_DESC=Specify a maximum amount of time in minutes to block the pipeline from running other jobs, which allows the analysis to complete. After the job completes, you can access the analysis status and results from the URL displayed in the log whether or not the analysis finished. If the analysis did not complete before the time specified, you can monitor the scan status at the URL or resubmit the job to have it continue waiting for the analysis to finish.  This value must be set to a whole number between 0 and 59.
