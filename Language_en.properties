ExtName=(Beta) IBM Security Static Analyzer
ExtDesc=Run a static security code scan using the IBM Security Static Analyzer on Bluemix 
ExtMessage=To leverage this extension, you must have the Static Analyzer service added to your space. You can have it automatically set up on the free plan with these <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/sla/bm-6814-01">terms of use</a> and bound to a bridge app by enabling the "Set up service and space for me" choice below.

ACCEPT_KEY=Set up service and space for me
ACCEPT_DESC=When this option is set to true, and the service is not already in your space, the builder attempts to add an instance on the "free" plan into this space and bind it to the containerbridge app to create the necessary credentials to run.  Review the <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/sla/bm-6814-01">Terms of Use</a>.

SUBMISSION_NAME_KEY=Submission Name 
SUBMISSION_NAME_DESC=The base name of the Static Analyzer job to be submitted.  This will be used for the name of the scan in the analysis submission queue.

REQUIRE_SUCCESS_KEY=Successful scan required to continue pipeline
REQUIRE_SUCCESS_DESC=If set to true, then this job will return success and allow following jobs in the pipeline to continue only if the scan analysis completes and there are zero issues found.<br><br>If set to anything other than true, then this job will always return success so that following jobs will run, regardless of whether the analysis has completed or the results thereof.  Results may still be seen in the log if it has completed, or on the linked URL if not.

WAIT_TIME_KEY=Wait for scan to complete
WAIT_TIME_DESC=Time in minutes to block the pipeline to allow the scan to complete.  After this time, the job will complete, even if the scan analysis is not done.  In this case, the scan status and results will be available at the url listed in the log when it completes, or the job can be resubmitted to continue waiting on the existing scan.  This must be set to a whole number from 0 to 59.
